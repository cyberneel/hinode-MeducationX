Many diseases and disorders affect populations all around the world. While some of them are more common, others are not as known. In honor of Halloween, here are some spooky diseases and disorders that deserve to be addressed.

# Sleep Paralysis

Sleep paralysis is a temporary inability that impairs speech and movement while falling asleep or waking up. It is characterized by a sensation of being awake but unable to move or talk, and it may last only a few minutes. Symptoms of sleep paralysis include a feeling of pressure, extreme fear, and inability to move or speak. Although the exact origins of sleep paralysis are unknown, it is believed to be associated with sleep disorders and certain mental health illnesses. The goal of treatment is to manage the problem by addressing its underlying causes and promoting better sleep hygiene. There are many medications for sleep paralysis. Citalopram is an antidepressant that helps regulate the sleep cycle. It is typically used by patients with narcolepsy with sleep paralysis. Since bipolar disorder is a common cause of sleep paralysis, many patients take lithium, an antimanic agent, which manages the root of the problem. There are also many foods that help combat sleep paralysis: fruits, vegetables, dairy products, etc. Foods that patients should avoid include tea, coffee, alcohol, and foods rich in sugars.

# Sleepwalking 

Sleepwalking, also known as somnambulism, is a sleep disorder in which a person walks or engages in other complex behaviors when they are mostly unconscious. Those who are sleep deprived, have a family history of the disorder, or are prone to frequent nightly awakenings are at a higher risk of experiencing it. It is more common in children than in adults. Sleepwalking occurs during non-REM (NREM) sleep, usually in stage 3 of the sleep cycle, which is also called deep sleep. Treatment is usually not necessary for isolated episodes of sleepwalking, which often don't indicate any major issues. Repeated sleepwalking, however, can point to an underlying sleep disorder. Sleepwalking in adults has a higher chance of being confused with or coexisting with other sleep disorders as well as medical conditions. It is important to protect sleepwalkers from potential injuries when they sleepwalk. Though there is limited research on the condition, some researchers are examining the possibility that aberrant neuron activity and small seizures in the temporal lobe may be associated with it. It is advised that you speak with a healthcare professional if you are exhibiting sleepwalking symptoms. Managing the condition by addressing its underlying causes and enhancing sleeping patterns—also known as sleep hygiene—are two possible treatment approaches.

# Cotard’s Syndrome 

Courtside syndrome, or corpse syndrome, is a rare mental disorder, makes people believe that they are dead, have lost their organs, or do not exist. Although the exact source of this phenomena is unknown, brain injuries such as dementia, encephalopathy, epilepsy, migraine, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and strokes are thought to be the cause. It generally affects individuals in their early 50s, particularly those who abuse drugs or suffer from depression, anxiety, or schizophrenia. Brain damage can be identified on imaging tests that are used to detect strokes, tumors, blood clots, and an injury. Cotard's syndrome can be treated with antipsychotics, antidepressants, and antianxiety medications. Another therapeutic approach is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). It causes tiny electrical currents to flow across the brain, which may alleviate certain mental health problems by altering the chemistry of the brain.

# Exploding Head Syndrome 

Exploding head syndrome is a sleep disorder that causes people to hear loud noises when they enter or exit deep sleep. Despite the fact that some people may experience anxiety, panic, or terror when they hear loud noises, exploding head syndrome is not a serious or life-threatening illness. The causes of exploding head syndrome are not fully understood, but it is believed to be linked to changes in brainstem activity and certain medical conditions such as migraines or ear problems. Though little is known about the illness, some researchers are examining the possibility that unusual neuron activity and small seizures in the temporal lobe may be associated with it. It is advised that you speak with a healthcare professional if you think you may have exploding head syndrome. Managing the condition by addressing its underlying causes and enhancing sleeping patterns—also known as sleep hygiene—are two possible treatment approaches. It is also possible to administer medications like lithium and citalopram to treat bipolar disorder and to control the sleep cycle, respectively.

# Porphyria

Porphyria is a group of rare genetic disorders that result from the accumulation of natural chemicals called porphyrins in the body. Heme, a component of hemoglobin that transports oxygen to the body's tissues and organs, is made by porphyrins. The two main types of porphyrias are acute porphyrias and cutaneous porphyrias. Symptoms of porphyria vary depending on the specific type and severity of the condition, and they can include excruciating pain in the abdomen, chest, legs, or back; digestive issues like nausea, vomiting, and constipation; muscle pain, tingling, numbness, weakness, or paralysis; red or brown urine; mental abnormalities like anxiety, hallucinations, or mental disorientation; palpitations, or rapid, irregular heartbeats; breathing issues; elevated blood pressure; seizures; sensitive skin that burns when exposed to the sun or occasionally artificial light; abrupt, excruciating skin redness and swelling; blisters on exposed skin, mainly on the hands, arms, and face; thin, fragile skin that changes color; itching; and excessive hair growth in affected regions. Porphyria is typically inherited by a mutated gene that is passed on to a kid by one or both parents. While there is no known cure for porphyria, it can be managed with medication and certain lifestyle modifications. Treatment for symptoms depends on the type of porphyria. Medications such as Hemin and Vitamin D may be prescribed to help repress production of porphyrins and correct vitamin D deficiency respectively.

# Alien Hand

Alien hand syndrome is a rare neurological disorder that results in uncontrollable motions in one or both hands. Damage to the brain's corpus callosum or frontal lobe is thought to be the root cause of the illness. Alien hand syndrome manifests as involuntary motions, loss of control over the affected limb, and a detached feeling from the limb. Though little is known about the illness, some researchers are examining the possibility that abnormal neuron activity and small seizures in the temporal lobe may be associated with it. If you are experiencing symptoms of alien hand syndrome, it is recommended that you consult a healthcare provider. The disorder can be managed by treating the underlying causes and improving sleeping habits—also known as sleep hygiene. Medications such as Citalopram and Lithium can help regulate the sleep cycle and manage bipolar disorder, respectively.

# Hemorrhaging in Eye

Subconjunctival hemorrhage is a disease that occurs when a tiny blood vessel bursts just below the conjunctiva, the transparent layer covering the eye. It can be brought on by events or behaviors that cause the fragile blood vessels in the eye to burst, or it can be brought on by traumatic injuries like tearing up, sneezing forcefully, straining, vomiting, or rubbing the eye, as well as side effects from blood thinners like Aspirin and Warfarin. Symptoms, which include a bright red patch in the sclera and scratchy feeling on the surface of the eye, may be alarming in appearance but are not harmful.

# Body Movement after Death

Rigor mortis is a natural post-mortem process that damages a deceased person's muscles. several alterations that take place in a body after death. The body becomes rigid due to muscle stiffness and temporary immobilization.

The usual course of rigor mortis is as follows:
- Onset: Although the precise timing of rigor mortis can vary based on factors including individual characteristics and the surrounding temperature, it often starts a few hours after death. It generally starts in the smaller muscles and then spreads to larger muscle groups.
- Peak: Rigor mortis reaches its maximum stiffness at around 12 to 24 hours after death. The body becomes extremely rigid at this point, making it challenging to move the limbs.
- Resolution: After reaching its peak, rigor mortis gradually starts to dissipate. It typically begins to subside after about 24 to 48 hours, and the muscles become more relaxed. Although the length of rigor mortis varies, it usually goes away completely in 1 to 3 days.

The precise processes underlying rigor mortis are associated with the post-mortem biochemical alterations in muscle cells. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is required for muscle contraction, is no longer produced once a person passes away. As ATP levels drop, the muscles become unable to relax, causing the stiffening associated with rigor mortis.
It's important to note that rigor mortis is a temporary and reversible condition. The body eventually loses its rigor mortis and becomes more relaxed as it continues to go through post-mortem changes and decomposition. When preparing a body for burial or cremation, mortuary staff and forensic professionals use this procedure to determine the time of death.
Reflexive muscle movements can occasionally occur soon after death, but they are often involuntary and not a sign of life. They are not deliberate, coordinated motions, but they can be brought on by the body's residual electrical activity.
